# tailwind.config.js

This is the configuration file for Tailwind CSS, which controls the project's design system and styling utilities.

## Highlights
- **Content Paths**: Configured to watch `index.html` and all files in the `src` directory for Tailwind class usage.
- **Design Tokens**:
    - **Font Family**: Standardizes the "Inter" font as the primary sans-serif typeface.
    - **Custom Animations**: Defines a `gradientMove` keyframe and animation, which is used to create the vibrant, shifting background effects seen on the Login and Welcome pages.
